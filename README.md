# Introduction

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Naomi and I am a **Junior Web Developer** at Yawt Digital.

# Career

In August 2021 I decided to make the jump from being a qualified accountant into the vast world of the tech industry.
I started out by firstly engaging in a **Full-Stack Development course** by Codecademy to hone some basic web development skills. 
I have now studied and practised using basic/intermediate JavaScript, but what a ride it has been! I'm very excited to further my skills and to next build on my current
HTML and CSS skills.
