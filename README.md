# Introduction

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Naomi and I am a **Frontend Developer**.

# Career

In August 2021 I decided to make the jump from being a qualified accountant into the vast world of web development.
I started out by firstly engaging in a **Full-Stack Development course** by Codecademy to hone some basic web development skills. 
I have now build multiple web applications using frameworks like Next.js and CSS libraries like TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. 
I have also build multiple sites using WordPress for the backend and HTML, CSS (Sass/Bootstrap), JavaScript and PHP for the frontend.
